<h3>Film</h3>

<p>
When I was in secondary school, I worked as a movie projector operator 
in a small cinema in my home town 
<a href="oudenbosch.html">Oudenbosch</a> for several years. 
I love watching good movies, and for a while I loved buying them as well. 
As a result, I own around 200 films on VHS (I know...) and DVD (I know...), 
many of which I haven't watched yet and probably never will.

When I moved back to the Netherlands in 2014, I became the proud owner of a 
<a href="http://cineville.nl/" target="_blank">Cineville</a> pass, giving me 
unlimited access to over 30 movie theaters in the Netherlands.
